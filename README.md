# Pizza Sales Dashboard â€“ Power BI

## About This Project
I created a Power BI dashboard to look at sales data from a pizza business. The dashboard shows things like total revenue, best-selling pizzas, and what times people place the most orders. I also used filters so users can explore the data by category and date.

## What I Used
- Power BI
- DAX
- Data Cleaning
- Filters & Visuals

## What I Learned
- How to build a full dashboard from scratch in Power BI
- Writing DAX formulas for KPIs like average order value
- Making dashboards that are interactive and easy to use

## File
- `pizza project.pbix`
